<p>If there�s one thing you can pretty much bet on as a parent, it�s that your kid is going to give themselves a haircut at some point during their childhood. Remember, it’s best to be conservative when you cut toddler hair — you can always take more off, but you can’t put it back. Using your comb, grab a section of hair on the sides that includes part of your top and bottom sections. This will help ensure that they stay still and keep their head in the same place for equal cutting.</p>
