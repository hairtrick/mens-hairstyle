Many fans found it impossible to believe that mikasa would be the one killing him, especially when she had been protecting him throughout the anime. Well, the answer is both yes and no.</p>

<p>Let�s take an objective look at why we believe eren is still alive in season 4 of attack on titan: Keep in mind that ‘see you later’ can also mean, “see you on the other side”. Shortly after, he saves armin, then the titan bites his arm off and then swallows without chewing him. Yes, she gets depressed with eren�s sudden disappearance, chops her hair off and loses her edge, but nobody seems to notice. Since the anime is still being broadcast, his death hasn’t been shown in the anime series yet, but we have no doubt that it will appear towards the end of the anime’s final season, we just don’t know the exact episode number. For fans, this could be a hard truth to deal with since we�ve been following his journey to avenge his parents� death and discover the world outside the walls from the very beginning.</p>
