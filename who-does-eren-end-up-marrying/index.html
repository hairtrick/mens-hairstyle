<p>Furthermore, mikasa was chosen by ymir to end her suffering for a single reason. People gave too much importance to her character and seriously thought she needed to complete an arc that already ended years ago. As an ackerman but also as mikasa, her life revolves around eren. I also doubt eren would expect his mom to end up dating and maybe marrying someone else which seems to be possible direction this is going in the recent chapter.</p>

<p>Eren jaeger is the protagonist of attack on titan. Even armin in this chapter more or less says that mikasa, while she should forget eren and move on, because he broke her heart, most likely won’t ever be able to forget eren, that’s why he punches him. But for historia, she didn’t hesitate to punch him back into reality and ended up saving eren from his own death wish as well as being chained. She is seen waking eren up, telling him that they need to return to home. On their way home, they meet hannes. Mikasa appears for the first time in year 845 somewhere inside wall maria.</p>
