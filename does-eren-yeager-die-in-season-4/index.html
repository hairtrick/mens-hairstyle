<p><strong>Does Eren Yeager Die In Season 4</strong>, Eren has officially died, and with his death comes the end of the titan power overall (saving all of those who were forcibly transformed in the penultimate chapter). The manga is finished so if this was a question relating to the manga i’d give a different answer, but since the question specifies “season 4” which is only halfway through, the answer will have to be “no.”. That means eren will live to 23 if he doesn’t beat the curse, which is unclear for multiple titan power holder.</p>
