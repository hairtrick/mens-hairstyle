The style is achieved by starting with a tool called a crochet hook that knotts hair, the hook is inserted then pushed and pulled until a knot is formed. This method causes the dreads to mature in a smooth pattern, leaving you with even ‘adult’ locs in the long run. The closely cropped sides and back not only highlight the dreadlocks but also make them appear longer. Use a head scarf for both aesthetic and protective reasons.</p>
