<p>Who is the strongest titan in Attack on Titan? Is it Eren?, Eren jaeger is bloodlusted, as is his foe. Reiner clearly lacks these qualities and can only make up for it with his armor. Is eren’s titan the strongest? Moreover zeke proved to be able to defeat reiner without effort, and, being called the strongest warrior, probably his power in combat is second only to the warhammer titan and the founder.</p>
