<p>This is one of the men’s quiff hairstyles where you have the options to choose from a high, mid, or low fade cut when paired with a bald, skin, or tapered cut. For decades, the quiff has prevailed as one of the most fashionable hairstyles for men. Inspired by the pompadour hairstyle, the quiff uses a short back and sides trim and presents long top hair that is styled upwards. It taps into that vintage appeal while still giving guys something fresh and attractive. The sides are closely clipped and the hair on top is styled upwards into a fashionable flip. The quiff haircut follows the “short on the sides and long on top” trend and is typically styled with some height and volume, then finished with a messy brushed back or combed over texture.</p>
