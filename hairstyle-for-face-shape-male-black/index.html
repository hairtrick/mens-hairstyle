<p>The oblong face shape has a balanced shape of jawline, cheekbones, and chin. You can even become a laughing stock. Add some inches to the top of your head by creating a little bit of extra volume with a higher quiff (the floof of hair on the top of your head) and slim out your face by avoiding any bulk and keeping the sides closely cropped. To do this, long faces need shortening, just as wide faces need lengthening. If you have curly hair and a round face, cut and taper the sides short to minimize fullness while leaving a little length on top to show off the curls. The length of the face is longer and it is sometimes compared with oval and rectangle shapes.</p>
