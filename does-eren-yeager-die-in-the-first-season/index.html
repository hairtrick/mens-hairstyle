<p>Did Eren Died In Season 1 canvasnexus, The hint is in the previous chapter, where zeke was almost on the brink of death. So no, we do not think eren yeager is dead. Because zeke caught eren before he passed on, eren teleports to the paths, where zeke is waiting for him. Any ordinary human would�ve died immediately from gabi�s shot, but eren�s titan power keeps him.</p>

<p>Pin by Uzumakikorra on Eren Yeager Attack on titan anime, Eren had become the world’s enemy sometime before this final confrontation, having become mad from his pursuit. However, i believe he is still living and can be revived. The legend of the first titan, ymir fritz, details how the titans� founder lived for a mere 13 years, and thereafter, no titan could surpass that limit. That is why mikasa had.</p>

<p>Does Eren Die in �Attack on Titan�? Who Did It and How Did, According to eren�s father, grisha jaeger, humans who eat intelligent titans to gain their powers will have their lifespan shortened due to the strain of titan powers on the body. Therefore, eren is technically dead in attack on titan, but he does not stay dead. However, fans are not yet convinced the protagonist is dead. Armin begins ridiculing eren, joking.</p>
