<p><strong>Does Eren Die In The End</strong>, The manga is finished so if this was a question relating to the manga i’d give a different answer, but since the question specifies “season 4” which is only halfway through, the answer will have to be. Eren has officially died, and with his death comes the end of the titan power overall (saving all of those who were forcibly transformed in the penultimate chapter). Despite changes to its approach, this was the original ending isayama originally planned years ago, and eren�s dream in chapter 1 proves that.</p>

Therefore, eren is technically dead in attack on titan, but he does not stay dead.</p>
